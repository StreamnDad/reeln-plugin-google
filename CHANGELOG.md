## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-06

- `upload.py` module — YouTube video upload (highlights and Shorts) with resumable MediaFileUpload
- `upload_highlights` feature flag (default `false`) — upload merged highlights on `ON_HIGHLIGHTS_MERGED`
- `upload_shorts` feature flag (default `false`) — upload Shorts on `POST_RENDER` (detected via `filter_complex`)
- LLM metadata flow — reads title/description/tags from `context.shared["uploads"]["google"]` when present
- Auto-add uploaded highlights to playlist when both `upload_highlights` and `manage_playlists` enabled
- `set_localizations()` for applying video translations in a separate API call
- Instance state caching (`_game_info`, `_youtube`, `_playlist_id`) across hooks within a game session

- `ON_GAME_FINISH` handler to reset cached state between games

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-05

- `playlist.py` module — find, create, and populate YouTube playlists with deduplication
- `manage_playlists` feature flag (default `false`) — game-specific playlist creation on `ON_GAME_INIT`
- Playlist-only mode supported (without livestream); when both flags are on, livestream video is auto-added to playlist
- Playlist ID written to `context.shared["playlists"]["google"]` for sibling plugins

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- `create_livestream` feature flag (default `false`) — livestream creation on `ON_GAME_INIT` now requires explicit opt-in

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Pass `description` and `thumbnail` from `GameInfo` to `create_livestream()` during `ON_GAME_INIT`
- Broadcast description and thumbnail image are now configurable via `reeln game init --description` / `--thumbnail`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Use game date and time for YouTube livestream `scheduledStartTime` instead of `datetime.now()`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Set `chmod 600` on OAuth credentials cache file to prevent world-readable tokens (skipped on Windows where NTFS uses ACLs)

### Added

- Initial plugin scaffolding with `GooglePlugin` class
- OAuth 2.0 credential management (`auth.py`) — cache, refresh, browser flow

- 100% line + branch test coverage
